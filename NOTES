Relase Notes - metar-2.0
--------------------------

Python-metar v2.0 expands on Tom Pollard's giant effort. Most notably, the
`station` object can now grab time series of data from NCDC's ASOS ftp
(5-minute data) or hourly data from wunderground.com

Python-metar v1.4 incorporates a handful of bug fixes and enhancements
made over the last couple of years.  Notably, Toby White contributed code to 
let the parser recognize and ignore trend forecasts and runway-state groups.

Starting with this release, new releases will be made available through my 
sourceforge project, at http://python-metar.sourceforge.net/.  I've also 
converted my code repository from CVS to Git, and made public copies of the 
Git repository available on Sourceforge and on Github. To clone the 
repository, you can use either

    git clone git://python-metar.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/python-metar
or
    git clone git://github.com/tomp/python-metar.git

The best way to submit bug reports or request assistance is still
to e-mail me at pollard@alum.mit.edu.
