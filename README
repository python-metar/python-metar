========================================================================
The metar library
========================================================================

Metar is a python package for interpreting METAR and SPECI coded
weather reports. 

METAR and SPECI are coded aviation weather reports.  The official
coding schemes are specified in the World Meteorological Organization
(WMO) Manual on Codes, vol I.1, Part A (WMO-306 I.i.A).  US conventions
for METAR/SPECI reports vary in a number of ways from the international
standard, and are described in chapter 12 of the Federal Meteorological
Handbook No.1. (FMH-1 1995), issued by NOAA.  See <http://metar.noaa.gov/>

This module handles all main-body groups in reports that follow the
WMO spec or the US conventions, except for trend groups.  The most
useful remark groups defined in the US spec are parsed, as well,
such as the cumulative precipitation, min/max temperature, peak
wind and sea-level pressure groups.  No other regional conventions
are formally supported, but a large number of variant formats found
in international reports are accepted."""

Current and historical METAR data can be obtained from various places.
The current METAR report for a given airport is available at the URL
<http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/data/observations/metar/stations/<station>.TXT>
where <station> is the four-letter ICAO airport station code.  The 
accompanying script get_report.py will download and decode the
current report for any specified station.  

The METAR reports for all stations (worldwide) for any "cycle" (i.e., hour) 
in the last 24 hours are available in a single file at the URL
<http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/data/observations/metar/cycles/<cycle>Z.TXT>
where <cycle> is a 2-digit cycle number (e.g., "00", "05" or "23").  

The WMO and US code specifications (and a file listing the ICAO
station codes) are available from my website at

Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Install this package in the usual way,

    python setup.py install

There's a small, inadequate test suite that can be run by saying

    python test/all_tests.py

There are a couple of sample scripts, described briefly below.

There's no real documentation to speak of, yet, but feel free to
contact me with any questions you might have about how to use this package.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contents
------------------------------------------------------------------------

README  ............... this file

parse_metar.py  ....... a simple commandline driver for the METAR parser

get_report.py ......... a script to download and decode the current reports
                        for one or more stations.

sample.py  ............ a simple script showing how the decoded data 
                        can be accessed. (see metar/*.py sources and the
                        test/test_*.py scripts for more examples.)

sample.metar  ......... a sample METAR report (longer than most).  Try
                        feeding this to the parse_metar.py script...
metar/
    Metar.py  ......... the implementation of the Metar class.  This class
                        parses and represents a single METAR report.

    Datatypes.py  ..... a support module that defines classes representing 
                        different types of meteorological data, including
                        temperature, pressure, speed, distance, direction 
                        and position.
test/
    all_tests.py  ..... a master test driver, which invokes all of the unit tests

    test_*.py  ........ individual test modules

setup.py  ............. installation script

Example
------------------------------------------------------------------------

See the sample.py script for an annonated demonstration of the use
of this code.  Just as an appetizer, here's an interactive example...
