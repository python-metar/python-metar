Change Log
==========

metar 1.3
---------

*) The datatype classes now have __str__ methods, so you can user the 
   generic str() function to get their string representation.

*) 'MMM' is now accepted to represent missing data in the wind group.

*) Fixed bugs in the handling of wind observations reported in KMH and MPH.
   (Thanks to Erik Bryer for reporting the MPH problem.)

*) '/' placeholders for missing data in the weather group are handled better now.

*) Added tests for KMH and MPH conversions to the test_speed.py script.

*) Added tests for wind-group parsing to the test_metar.py script.

*) Accept "11/2" as equivalent to "1 1/2" in the visibility group.

*) Fixed a bug that prevented the error handler in get_report.py from reporting
   the error message :-)  (Thanks to Erik Bryer for reporting this.)


metar 1.2
---------

*) Save the 1-, 3-, 6- and 24-hr preciptation values as Metar attributes.

*) Save the 6- and 24-hour max and min temperatures as Metar attributes.

*) Save the peak wind speed and direction as Metar attributes.

*) Save the sea-level pressure as a Metar attribute.  The sea-level
     pressure is treated as the station pressure, as well, if no station
     pressure is otherwise reported.

*) Added a peak_wind() method, to report peak wind data.

*) 'QNH' and 'SLP' pressure groups are now accepted.  'INS' at the end of
   a pressure group is recognized, as well.

*) A group of four digits is accepted as a pressure group, now.

*) Present-weather and cloud-cover lines are only written in the textual
   output if observations of those phenomena were reported.

*) The character 'O' is treated as a zero in the cloud-height, visibility
   and wind fields.

*) 'CORR' (in the modification field) is interpretted as 'COR'

*) 'NIL' and 'FINO' (in the modification field) are interpretted as 'NO DATA'

*) 'K', 'T' and 'LT' are all interpretted as 'KT'.

*) 'SCK' is interpretted as 'SKC'

*) 'MM' is now accepted as a placeholder in the 'temp' and 'dewpoint' groups.

*) An 'integrity' field ('+' or-) has been created.

*) 'RVRNO' groups are ignored, now.

*) '0VC' is treated as 'OVC'.

*)  A pressure group consisting of just four digits with no leading 'A' or
    'Q' is accepted now.  The units are assumed to be inches if the value
    is greater than 2500.

*) An 'O' in a cloud height field is treated as a '0'.

*) Modified to handle "MIFZFG".

*) Moved regexp matching out of the _parse* methods and into the __init__
   method.  This lets me avoid unnecessary method calls and removes a bunch
   of previously duplicated code.  It gives a 10-15% speedup.  The ability to 
   ignore trend groups has been temporarily lost as a result of this change.

*) The date parsing code will assume we're in the previous month if the day
   is greater than today's date.

*) Rearranged the VISIBILITY_RE regexp to fix a parsing bug,  which had
   caused "1 1/2SM" to be parsed as two groups.

*) Modified SKY_RE regexp to accept two to four digits in the cloud height,
   and to treat 'O' as '0', if found in the height.

*) Fixed a bug (a typo) in the vertical visibility handling code.  This was
   reported by Joseph Sheedy.

*) Fixed a bug in reporting maximum visibility when there was no direction
   for the maximum visibility.

*) Changed the way the visibility group was parsed to allow better
   handling of units.  '9999U' and '7000M' are now accepted.

*) Added support for sky group of the form '///030///', indicating cloud
   height without coverage or type info.

*) Support "KTS" as an alternative to "KT".
*) Support "XX" as a placeholder for a missing temperature or dewpoint.
(These are violations of the spec, but are sometimes used, anyway.)
